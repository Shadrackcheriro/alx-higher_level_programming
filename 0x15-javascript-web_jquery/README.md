0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery
JavaScript-
is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

Why JavaScript in the browser?
Now that we can structure the document and its content with HTML, and that we can style it in many ways with CSS, we may want to go beyond those capabilities (dynamically change the HTML document, perform some operations based on some current circumstances, …). JavaScript was created with exactly that goal in mind, and is still being used as such; its recent popular renewal as a language for scripts and web back-ends using Node.js is quite recent. All browsers expect HTML, CSS and JavaScript; Whatever you want to write for the web, even the most complex applications (even GMail, Google Maps, …) will have no choice but to be composed of those three technologies if they want to be understood by browsers.
